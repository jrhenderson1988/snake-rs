# Snake

A Rust implementation of the legendary [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game, commonly found on old Nokia mobile phones. This project was primarily created to support an associated [blog post](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/10/08/lets-build-snake-with-rust.html) which aims to help new Rustaceans get to grips with the language.

The game is terminal based and uses [Crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) to take care of cross-platform differences when building the interface and accepting user input.
